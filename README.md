This project was created as a **personal/hobby project** to improve my coding skills and explore new technologies.  
I incorporated the use of **AI-assisted coding tools** (such as ChatGPT, Claude Ai and GitHub Copilot) during development.  

These tools supported me in:
- Speeding up repetitive coding tasks
- Exploring alternative implementations
- Debugging and refining code

All project design decisions, structure, and integration work were done by me aided with online tuition. The project represents both my **independent learning journey** and my ability to use modern AI-powered development workflows.
